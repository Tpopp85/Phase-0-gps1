* What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
  
  I was struggling with understanding how to push and pull different repositories
* What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
  
  It became a lot clearer to me how I should use gitHub to pair in the future.
* What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
  
  I asked the pair which role he was most comfortable in.  We asked the guide a lot of clarifying questions to help us make better sense of the instructions.
* What still confuses you about Git?
  
  Nothing confuses me too much at this stage.  I feel more comfortable using Git than I did earlier in the week, but I am sure there will be things in the future that cause me trouble.
* How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
  
  The first experience was good.  It went a little slow but I think that is just because we are getting used to using google hangouts and we were a little hesitant to take control.
