The Git concept I was still struggling with was when the correct time to megrge/ push your branches / commits was correct, although I only had a few questions on this. I also noticed that sometimes my local repo could be adding commits that put me ahead of the origin when I did not make any commits at all.

I understand that I do not have to merge my branches and then push them to Github, I can simply push the new branch instead.

Whenever I needed help on syntax or some code I tried to ask for the correct answer. I also asked for clarification when dealing with the instructions.

Git has been randomly adding commits when I did not commit anything, in this case we had pushed a new branch, then ran git branch git checkout master ls git status and it displayed that we were 2 commits ahead of the master. Eventually after pushing at the end of this session it said we were up to date.

Overall it was a good experience I think we both worked well. I do believe that some of the instructions were unclear and it took us longer to get into a rythym than I would have liked, but during release 4 we found good speed and work flow.
